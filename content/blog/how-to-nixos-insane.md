I've been using NixOS for a while now, and had my fair share of troubles with it. My main usecases for it are:

- I want my different machines (home, work, laptop) to stay synchronized when it comes to config and installed tools.
- I want to be able to wipe machines and reinstall them easily without having to do a ton of setup.
- I want to be able to easily add new machines and have them set up in the same way as my other machines.

After a lot of trial and error, I think I've landed on a good solution to achieve all of this while working around common issues that NixOS tends to have in the real world. In this post, I'll try to outline how I do things and explain how you can adapt my config for yourself.

Note that this is not meant as a general introduction to NixOS - There are lots of great tutorials already. I'm only detailing how I use NixOS to achieve my goals with relatively little effort here.

## Keeping it Simple

When looking at other NixOS configs, one thing that I see a lot is deeply nested directory structure, seperate files for every package that is installed, and custom modules with options that can be configured for every host.  
This has many advantages and offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to configuring your machines. It also introduces a big maintenance burden and makes adding new packages harder, since you'll always think about the configuration API you'll have to write for yourself. Since I want all my machine configs to be *very* similar, I do away with all of that and try to keep my config as straightforward and flat as possible.

Here's what it looks like:

```
~/.flake
  - config/ # Dotfiles
    - nvim
    - zsh
    - direnv
    - git
    - ...
  - hosts/ # Host-specific config
    - mira/
      - config/ # Host-specific dotfiles
      - configuration.nix # Host-specific system config
      - hardware-configuration.nix # Generated by NixOS per host
    - hei/
      - config/
      - configuration.nix
      - hardware-configuration.nix
    - ...
  - flake.nix # Flake inputs and plumbing
  - home.nix # Home-manager configuration
  - system.nix # General NixOS configuration
  - overlay.nix # nixpkgs customization
  - packages.nix # List of all installed packages
  - devshells.nix # Global shells for development
  - justfile # Recipes for formatting, building the config, etc.
```

Let's go through the nix files one by one.

### `flake.nix`

This is the entrypoint.

```nix
{
  description = "system config";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    # nixos-hardware provides some predefined configuration for specific laptop
    # models, CPUs and so on.
    nixos-hardware.url = "github:NixOS/nixos-hardware/master";

    # Use home-manager as a flake
    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    # Everything after this point is optional.

    # I want to use neovim nightly instead of the latest stable version
    neovim-nightly-overlay = {
      url = "github:nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    # Speed up nixpkgs searches by using a prebuilt database
    nix-index-database = {
      url = "github:nix-community/nix-index-database";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    # More custom packages or overlays you might want to install go here.
    # For example, I have a few tools that I've written myself, which I add as
    # inputs here:
    serve = {
      url = "github:happenslol/serve";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  outputs = inputs @ {
    nixpkgs,
    home-manager,
    nix-index-database,
    ...
  }: let
    # All my hosts are linux machines - This could be added as a parameter to
    # `mkHost` if yours aren't.
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    username = "happens";

    # Add my own overlays and overlays provided by flakes.
    overlays = [
      (import ./overlay.nix)
      inputs.neovim-nightly-overlay.overlays.default
    ];

    # Apply the overlays and allow unfree packages (slack, zoom, discord, ...)
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      inherit system;
      overlays = overlays;
      config.allowUnfree = true;
    };

    # This creates the actual host configuration. Instead of passing lots of
    # options for every host here, this includes per-host configuration files.
    #
    # The stateVersion can be different per host, and basically just defines
    # what version of NixOS was current when you installed the system first.
    mkHost = { hostname, stateVersion }: (nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      inherit system pkgs;

      # Pass these args to every module.
      specialArgs = {inherit inputs stateVersion hostname username system;};

      modules = [
        # Include our general system config.
        ./system.nix

        # As mentioned above, we include the host-specific config as modules
        # here from the hosts directory.
        (./. + "/hosts/${hostname}/hardware-configuration.nix")
        (./. + "/hosts/${hostname}/configuration.nix")

        # All inputs that provide extra modules go here.
        nix-index-database.nixosModules.nix-index
        home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager

        # Include our home-manager configuration.
        {
          home-manager = {
            # Make sure we use the same nixpkgs as the rest of the config.
            useGlobalPkgs = true;

            # This allows us to install all of our packages through
            # home-manager, instead of globally.
            useUserPackages = true;

            # Same as above - these will be available in our `home.nix`.
            extraSpecialArgs = {inherit inputs stateVersion hostname system username;};
            users.${username} = import ./home.nix;
          };
        }
      ];
    });
  in {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      mira = mkHost {
        hostname = "mira";
        stateVersion = "24.11";
      };
      hei = mkHost {
        hostname = "hei";
        stateVersion = "24.11";
      };

      # More hosts...
    };

    # Adding devshells here allows us to use them like this:
    # `nix develop ~/.flake#<name>`
    devShells.${system} = import ./devshells.nix pkgs;
  };
}
```

That was a lot! But with all of this set up, the rest of the files are a lot shorter.

### `system.nix`

These are configuration options that apply to every machine. I'll just show a few options that are non-obvious here or that I find especially useful here.

```nix
{ pkgs, stateVersion, username }: {
  system = {inherit stateVersion;};

  nix = {
    # Make sure we use the same nixpkgs version as in this flake when we use
    # `nix-shell -p`
    registry.nixkpgs.flake = inputs.nixpkgs;
    nixPath = ["nixpkgs=${inputs.nixpkgs.outPath}"];

    # Enable modern NixOS features
    settings.experimental-features = ["nix-command" "flakes" "pipe-operators"];
  };

  programs = {
    # Add systemwide programs here, e.g.:
    command-not-found.enable = false;
    nix-index-database.comma.enable = true;
    steam.enable = true;

    # More on this later. This allows running a lot of unpatched dynamic binaries.
    nix-ld = {
      enable = true;
      libraries = builtins.concatLists (builtins.attrValues (import ./ld.nix pkgs));
    };
  };

  environment = {
    # Add packages that you want to be available no matter what here.
    systemPackages = with pkgs; [neovim curl kitty];
  };

  services = {
    # Enable any services you want here, e.g.:
    upower.enable = true;
    openssh.enable = true;
    dbus.enable = true;
  };

  # Add the user. You can also add extra groups to the user here.
  users.users.${username}.isNormalUser = true;
}
```

### `home.nix`

This is where I install my packages, link my dotfiles, and configure home-manager.

The most important thing to note here is that we use `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` to link our dotfiles. This lets us create symlinks to our dotfiles in this repository instead of symlinks to the nix store, which would be read only. Additionally, changes to dotfiles don't require rebuilding NixOS to be applied. I didn't do this at first and it was really painful.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, stateVersion, hostname, system }: let
  home = "/home/${username}";

  # See above.
  dotfiles = config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "${home}/.flake/config";
  hostDotfiles = config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "${home}/.flake/hosts/${hostname}/config";
in {

};
```

### `packages.nix`

### `overlay.nix`

### `devshells.nix`
